# Superstore-Sales-Analysis-and-Data-Visulization
This project was about getting trained how to use SQL to analyze a real-world database,
how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, 
how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database, and how to visualize the data using the PowerBI tool.
